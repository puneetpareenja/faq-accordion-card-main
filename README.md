# Frontend Mentor - FAQ Accordion Card

![Design preview for the FAQ Accordion Card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my submission for Frontend Mentor's FAQ Accordion Card Challenge. I have used Flexbox, Sass and Jquery in this challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

The project is hosted on [Vercel](https://fm-faq-accordion-eight.vercel.app/).

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
